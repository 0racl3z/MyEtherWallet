#### Check your public address on EthVM for a full list of recent activity

**1. It all looks familiar.**

- If everything looks in order, but you’re missing funds, please reach out to us for further information. 
  - Refer to the contact form at the end of the page.

**2. It looks very unfamiliar!**

- If you’re seeing unfamiliar transactions, it’s possible that your wallet has been compromised. 
  - Please think back to your most recent actions. 
  - Did you enter your key on any sites, or access your wallet from an unsecure location?

**We cannot recover funds, reverse transactions, or locate the IP of any wallet address. We are an empty, client-side interface used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, but we do not control the blockchain.** 

Feel free to reach out with more information so we can go from here.
