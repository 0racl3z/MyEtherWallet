## There's an Error When I Try to Make a Transaction

#### Refer to this list of common errors and solutions.

**1. ‘Invalid Address’**

- MEW only supports Ethereum-related crypto transactions. 
- If you’re trying to send a token that has launched mainnet, you will likely need to send this crypto to an Ethereum address at an exchange like Binance to make the swap to mainnet.

**2. ‘Not Checksummed’**

- The checksum version of your address is the version that includes both capital and lowercase letters, for accuracy. 
      \* The address itself is not different. 
  <br>

- You can find this version by searching your address on EthVM.

**3. ‘Out of Gas’ or ‘Insufficient funds’**

- All transactions on the Ethereum blockchain require ETH for the fuel to make transactions happen. 
      \* We recommend having at least .01 ETH to cover this cost.
  <br>

- None of this fee comes to us, but goes to the remote miners working to keep the blockchain secure and progressing.
