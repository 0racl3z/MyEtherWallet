MyEtherWallet is a doorway to the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to manage their own funds without a centralized platform. -*Stephen, #MEWForce*

## Philosophy
- **Empower the people**: Give people the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain easily, without having to run a full node.
- **Make it easy & free**: Everyone should be able to create a wallet and send Ether & Tokens without additional cost.
- **People are the Priority**: People are the most important & their experience trumps all else. If monetization worsens the experience, we don't do it. (e.g. ads)
- **A learning experience, too**: We want to educate about Ethereum, security, privacy, the importance of controlling your own keys, how the blockchain works, and how Ethereum and blockchain technologies enable a better world.
- **If it can be hacked, it will be hacked**: Never save, store, or transmit secret info, like passwords or keys.
- **Offline / Client-Side**: User should be able to run locally and offline without issue.
- **Private**: No tracking!!! No emails. No ads. No demographics. We don't even know how many wallets have been generated, let alone who / what / where you are.
- **Open source & audit-able**
